        <h1>HOW TO PLAY</h1>
        <p>Welcome to hangman. This will be a short paragraph describing you how to play</p>
        <p>The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes representing each letter of the word.</p>  
        <p>If you click a letter which occurs in the word to be guessed, the computer writes it in all its correct positions.</p>
        <p>If the selected letter does not appear in the word, the computer creates a tally mark by drawing one element of a hung stick figure.</p>
        <p> If the word is correct, the game is over and you win. Otherwise, the computer may choose to penalize the guesser by adding an element to the diagram.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, you lose if you make enough inaccurate guesses to allow the computer to finish the diagram.</p>
        <p>HAVE FUN!</p>
